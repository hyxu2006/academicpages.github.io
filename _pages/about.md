Welcome to [Hongyu Xu](https://hyxu2006.github.io)'s Homepage!        

I am a senior machine learning/computer vision engineer at Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA. I obtained my Ph.D. from University of Maryland, College Park and was advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/).  Over my Ph.D. years, I have worked on a variety of topics such as deep learning for generic object detection, image/video face recognition/verification, domain adaptation, dictionary learning and sparse representation. I did one internship at [PARC-Xerox (Palo Alto Research Center)](https://www.parc.com/) and two at [Snap Research](https://www.snap.com/en-US/). I received my M.S. degree from University of Maryland and B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Science from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
