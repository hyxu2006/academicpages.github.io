Welcome to [Hongyu Xu](https://hyxu2006.github.io)'s Homepage!        

Hongyu Xu is currently a Ph.D. candidate at University of Maryland, College Park, working with Prof. [Rama Chellappa](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/). His research interests include pattern recognition, computer vision and machine learning. He has been working on image/video face recognition/verification, domain adaptation for object recognition, dictionary learning and sparse representation. He received his M.S. degree along the way from University of Maryland in 2016. He received his B.S. degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2012.
