Welcome to [Hongyu Xu](https://hyxu2006.github.io)'s Homepage!        

I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, College Park. My research advisor is [Prof. Rama Chellappa](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/). I am also affiliated with the [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/). 

I have worked on several topics such as deep learning for generic object detection, image/video face recognition/verification, domain adaptation, dictionary learning and sparse representation. My research interests include pattern recognition, deep learning, computer vision and machine learning.

I have done one internship at [PARC-Xerox (Palo Alto Research Center)](https://www.parc.com/) and two at [Snap Research](https://www.snap.com/en-US/). I received my M.S. degree along the way from University of Maryland in 2016 and B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Science from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2012.

# Recent News
* Feb, 2019. Our paper "[A Fast and Accurate System for Face Detection, Identification, and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07586)" accepted in IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (<b>TBIOM</b>).
* Feb, 2019. Our paper "[Thresholded Features with Sparse Support Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05515)" accepted in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (<b>TCSVT</b>). For the first time, we presented two theoretical recovery guarantees for the fast thresholded feature to exactly recover the nonzero support of the true sparse code, from which we also witnessed more hidden links between sparse coding and deep learning.
