## Abstract
The availability of large annotated datasets and affordable computation power have led to impressive improvements in the performance of CNNs on various object detection and recognition benchmarks. These, along with a better understanding of deep learning methods, have also led to improved capabilities of machine understanding of faces. CNNs are able to detect faces, locate facial landmarks, estimate pose, and recognize faces in unconstrained images and videos. In this paper, we describe the details of a deep learning pipeline for unconstrained face identification and verification which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We propose a novel face detector, Deep Pyramid Single Shot Face Detector (DPSSD), which is fast and capable of detecting faces with large scale variations (especially tiny faces). We give design details of the various modules involved in automatic face recognition: face detection, landmark localization and alignment, and face identification/verification. We provide evaluation results of the proposed face detector on challenging unconstrained face detection datasets. Then, we present experimental results for IARPA Janus Benchmarks A, B and C (IJB-A, IJB-B, IJB-C), and the Janus Challenge Set 5 (CS5).
